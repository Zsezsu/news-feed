This is one of my full stack application which I have created during my software developing studies.

This application built in Java backend for practicing the [Java Servlets.](https://www.baeldung.com/intro-to-servlets)

On the frontend side I used Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS.


# Usage

`mvn jetty:run` command starts the application


# About the project

**My general requirements during development phase:**

- For the whole project, get the data using [Hacker news API](https://api.hnpwa.com/v0) on the backend side.
- Practicing on backend: 
  - Working with Java web servlets
  - Serialization in Java (JSON/GSON)
- Practicing on frontend:
    - Refreshing my knowledge of asynchronously fetching data from backend using JavaScript

- All code is pushed to the GitHub repository in atomic commits.
- The implemented feature-related commits are managed on separate feature branches and merged in a pull request to the development branch
